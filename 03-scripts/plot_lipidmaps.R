### ctenophores: wild animals annotated with continuous environmental metadata

## here's a little block of code that sorts the samples based on depth and temperature
## intended as an example of how samples can be ordered systematically
samps_sorted = lmapdata %>% 
  group_by(sp) %>% 
  # filter E. coli out of the dataset
  filter(!str_detect(sp, "Ecol")) %>% 
  mutate(
    # calculate species mean depth and temp
    across(c(depth, temp), mean, .names="{.col}_mean"),
    # assign species to temperature and depth slices
    cold = (temp_mean <= 10),
    deep = (depth_mean >= 200)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(cold, -temp_mean, deep, depth_mean) %>% 
  # lock in species order as a factor
  mutate(sp = sp %>% factor(., unique(.))) %>% 
  # sort by individual temp and depth within sp
  arrange(sp, -temp, depth) %>% 
  group_by(sp, eid) %>% 
  summarize()

sp_order  = samps_sorted$sp %>% unique()
